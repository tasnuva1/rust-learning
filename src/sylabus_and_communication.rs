// They writes in 1 setting or in one go, to get something to work. Don't take longer puses to learn a thing. Write the crappy code then understand the meaning behind it.

// In the end you have the code. then go learn to improve that code.

// For choosing or deciding The outcome, What you are learning, what course you are learning

// For getting the outcome / my own peace of code / solving chalenges by sudo code

// Skill building: solve the puzzle, going deep: Coding To dos, do the thing you have to do. what is the perpose of this thing? is to apply.

// ***********************************
// Find out you intrest in what database/information, Which tech you got an edge? Server, DNS server, Email server, BitTorrent, TCP, SQLite, Redis, OS, Docker, Interpreter, Kafka, Shell-DONE, message broadcast, web framework, OS.

// NOTE: inside projects solution: some tools is needed (https://www.amplenote.com/notes/c1af8150-5d8c-11ef-a7d3-22074e34eefe#Projects-and-tools) & some data stucture is needed - why this? so space time is needed.

// (Both tools when it's need it you wanna know the how to, indivual pices how they work) (So even if it's simple usage, but the artitacure/enginering is magnifisan)

// **which course is natural to you. Maybe after make a project it will be natural. we don't know.**

// and **inside projects solution:** some tools is needed, solution: some data stucture is needed - why this? so space time is needed. (tools - how to, indivual pices how they work)

// How do you desing different storage system? context & perfomates wase which one's best or appropiate?
// storage ba mathod ki hoba, like memory caching, assassability ki hoba.

// hipothasis: basir vag instaction expainsive hoe na, which mathod you are working in is the only expainsive thing. real example nai on the head right now.

// inferstuture system setting/setup means or do it by cloud computing: ./1. networking-for-first-time-with-could-computing.rs - renting out severs, just know specpal hardware & networking. all the hardware is networking devices anyways. mare metel - pain = aws

// To do:
// - couse nia dak ho, sik ha dak ho. crash course to deep course
// - indivual pices how they work, low level guy http server made, workings of an language, network stack.
// - tarpor ar ta tar pora dak ha ja ba.
// - linux small pices how they work.

// ****** YOU NEED TO *MAKE/APPLY/IMPLEMENT* DIFFRENT TYPES OF SMALL & BIG SYSTEMS ******
